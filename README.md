# Age-Based Risk Prediction Model

## 📄 Overview
This project is an AI-powered tool designed to predict a **Risk Status** (0 or 1) based on a person's **Age**.

By utilizing a **Logistic Regression** algorithm, this system analyzes the input age and determines the likelihood of the status being positive (1) or negative (0).

## 📊 Dataset Information
The model was trained on the `Book1.csv` dataset, which contains the following features:
* **age:** The age of the individual (Numeric).
* **status:** The target variable indicating risk (Binary: 0 or 1).

## ✨ Key Features
* **Simple Input:** Only requires "Age" to make a prediction.
* **Binary Classification:** Clearly outputs status as 0 or 1.
* **Lightweight:** Minimal processing power required.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy
* **Input Data:** CSV format
